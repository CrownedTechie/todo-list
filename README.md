## Introduction
This is a common tool that allows users to write down their goals, experiences or achievements they would like to accomplish in a laidback and easygoing way. 

## Features
1. __List Display:__ Explore all the items on your todo list, quickly checking and reviewing all the listed items.
    
2. __Add New Lists:__ You can use an add button (represented by an `New Task`) to include new items to your list.

3. __Achievement Tracking:__ Mark items on your todo list as completed once you've completed them. If you accidentally marked an item, it's easy to unmark them.

4. __User-friendly Interface:__ Explore a clean and simple interface that's all about keeping things straightforward. It's easy to move around and interact with it.

5. __Data Storage:__ Your list stays intact even if you close and reopen the app, unless you choose to delete it voluntarily.

6. __Sorting and Searching__ You can sort your todos based on completed or incomplete status and also search for a todo easily.

## My Process
Rather than using custom hooks for state management in such a simple project, I went with context API (my first time using it) to practicalize what I've been learning.
